          <h1>Background</h1>
          <p>I'm a Hudson Valley, NY native, aiming to transition into software engineering. Reliable and driven, I have handled turbine jet engine parts, solar panels, and other complex manufacturing processes. I've worked in lean manufacturing with a focus on quality, teamwork, and productivity. </br></br>
          I'm currently a dental assistant. The patient facing aspect of dental is enjoyable, and it has been a great opportunity to polish my communication and social empathy. I get great satisfaction from fostering a comfortable environment and helping people through an extremely stressful experience.</br></br>
          I have just recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive boot camp. The pace was fast, and I really enjoyed it. GA has really helped cement my interest in programming and development. It has been a very rewarding experience, and I'm eager to continue to learn.</br></br>

      <p >This app was created as a team project during my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive boot camp. This project was built using React, Express.JS, Node.js, and MongoDB. The app allows users to search recipes and favorite them. They can then go into favorited recipes and track whether or not they have the ingredients. We also utilized react-router-dom for dynamic routing.  </p><br/>

      <p>We focused on maximizing our communication from the get go. The first 2 days of the project we met and discussed possible projects. We entered the proposal submission day with our project already planned. We met on zoom and worked on the project together at least every other day in which we did not have class.
  
      </p><br/>
  
      <p>I predominantly worked on the React app and the api calls for the external recipe database. This project allowed me to really dive into React-Router and hooks. It was built using only functional components and utilizing hooks to make up for the lack of class components.
          </p><br/>
  
      <p>The css was done colaboratively. One person was coding while the other 2 focused on getting resources and assisting. It was a very intersting experience. It was extremely nice having another set of eyes to help solve issues and to receive instant feedback on styling.
      </p><br/>    
  
      <p>The front and back-ends of this MERN stack app are hosted on Heroku.  
      </p><br/>   
  
      <p>This group project was a great time. We were able to play to each of our own strengths and maximize our effectiveness. Our greatest strength was our communication. We were constantly messaging and colaborating so any issues were known and addressed quickly.

      <p >This is a React-Native game themed after old school dungeon crawlers and the Combat Hero game books. It is turn based with a map built out of a series of rooms. The player will navigate the dungeon while trying to catch their opponent and defeat them.</p><br/>
      <p >The player can log in using their google account through Auth0. They can save their game to the backend and load the data from their to start from where they left off. The backend is a MongoDB noSQL server using Mongoose, Express, and Node.js.</p><br/>
      <p >I used React-Native-Navigation for multiple screens and React-Native-Paper to assist with styling. All images were generated using Midjourney.</p><br/>
      <p >A lot of the time with this project was getting confortable with React-Native and ironing out bugs with Auth0. This project was still a lot of fun and I am excited to expand it further.</p><br/><br/><br/>

      <p >This game was submitted to the LowRezJam 2022. The jam required a 64 x 64 pixel resolution. The jam ran for 2 weeks.  </p><br/>
  
      <p>My plan was to make a shmup style game without the shooting element. I instead went with a breakout style ball bouncing mechanic. I wanted to have well rounded enemy variety and a boss with multiple attack patterns. I also included floating bricks similar to a breakout game.  </p><br/>
  
      <p>It was built in Gamemaker and coded in GML. The ball physics run off the box2d physics engine. I ended up using sub-pixel movements which aren't necessarily in the spirit of the jam theme and is something I'll need to remember for next year.
          </p><br/>
  
      <p>I really enjoyed learning the box2d physics engine and diving into the shmup gameplay style. It gave me plenty of opportunities to experiment scripting enemy spawns and attack patterns. We did very well planning and executing. I planned all the enemies and assets out at the start to give my artist as much time as possiblle. 
      </p><br/>    
  
      <p>
      It was tiring but satisfying. I’m really happy with how it turned out and am excited for the next jam I enter.

    <p >This project was my 1st project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive boot camp. It is a 1 vs 1 bomb placing game similar to Bomberman. It uses grid based movement and the goal is to blow up your opponent.

    </p><br/>

    <p>My plan was to make a shmup style game without the shooting element. I instead went with a breakout style ball bouncing mechanic. I wanted to have well rounded enemy variety and a boss with multiple attack patterns. I also included floating bricks similar to a breakout game.  </p><br/>

    <p>The map is drawn on the canvas using an array as a reference. Different values in the array correspond to different sections of my tile map. It calculates positions and collisions based off another array which is updated as players move and bombs are placed.
        </p><br/>

    <p>I used an interval timer to set my game tick rate. Every tick it clears my canvas, redraws objects, and updates variables. The bombs and explosions are instantiated from 2 classes and are added to arrays. The arrays are run through every tick which draws each object and subtracts from a variable I am using as a timer on each object. When that value is below 0 they explode or fade away.
    </p><br/>    
    
    <p>The bombs and explosions change sprites using a timer that changes the position on the tile map from which they are drawn. The explosions reference the position of the bombs and place explosions in the open spots in their position and the 4 cardinal directions around them.
    </p><br/>    

    <p>This was really fun to make. It was a bit hectic just because it was our first project. It was really neat to use the canvas element and timers to animate and run everything.</p><br/>
