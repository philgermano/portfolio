      <p >This app was created as a team project during my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive boot camp. This project was built using React, Express.JS, Node.js, and MongoDB. The app allows users to search recipes and favorite them. They can then go into favorited recipes and track whether or not they have the ingredients. We also utilized react-router-dom for dynamic routing.  </p><br/>

      <p>We focused on maximizing our communication from the get go. The first 2 days of the project we met and discussed possible projects. We entered the proposal submission day with our project already planned. We met on zoom and worked on the project together at least every other day in which we did not have class.
  
      </p><br/>
  
      <p>I predominantly worked on the React app and the api calls for the external recipe database. This project allowed me to really dive into React-Router and hooks. It was built using only functional components and utilizing hooks to make up for the lack of class components.
          </p><br/>
  
      <p>The css was done colaboratively. One person was coding while the other 2 focused on getting resources and assisting. It was a very intersting experience. It was extremely nice having another set of eyes to help solve issues and to receive instant feedback on styling.
      </p><br/>    
  
      <p>The front and back-ends of this MERN stack app are hosted on Heroku.  
      </p><br/>   
  
      <p>This group project was a great time. We were able to play to each of our own strengths and maximize our effectiveness. Our greatest strength was our communication. We were constantly messaging and colaborating so any issues were known and addressed quickly.

      <p >The player can log in using their google account through Auth0. They can save their game to the backend and load the data from their to start from where they left off. The backend is a MongoDB noSQL server using Mongoose, Express, and Node.js.</p><br/>
      <p >I used React-Native-Navigation for multiple screens and React-Native-Paper to assist with styling. All images were generated using Midjourney.</p><br/>
      <p >A lot of the time with this project was getting confortable with React-Native and ironing out bugs with Auth0. This project was still a lot of fun and I am excited to expand it further.</p><br/><br/><br/>

      <p >This game was submitted to the LowRezJam 2022. The jam required a 64 x 64 pixel resolution. The jam ran for 2 weeks.  </p><br/>
  
      <p>My plan was to make a shmup style game without the shooting element. I instead went with a breakout style ball bouncing mechanic. I wanted to have well rounded enemy variety and a boss with multiple attack patterns. I also included floating bricks similar to a breakout game.  </p><br/>
  
      <p>It was built in Gamemaker and coded in GML. The ball physics run off the box2d physics engine. I ended up using sub-pixel movements which aren't necessarily in the spirit of the jam theme and is something I'll need to remember for next year.
          </p><br/>
  
      <p>I really enjoyed learning the box2d physics engine and diving into the shmup gameplay style. It gave me plenty of opportunities to experiment scripting enemy spawns and attack patterns. We did very well planning and executing. I planned all the enemies and assets out at the start to give my artist as much time as possiblle. 
      </p><br/>    
  
      <p>
      It was tiring but satisfying. I’m really happy with how it turned out and am excited for the next jam I enter.

    </p><br/>

    <p>It was a bit hectic just because they had not had much of a web prescence before now. It was only 2 weeks before the symposium so the schedule was tight. I was able to have it mocked up quickly with enough time for revisions. We had it hosted and available with plenty of time before the event. </p><br/>

      <p>The app has full CRUD functionality. It was built using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and EJS. This was the first app we hosted on Heroku and had a few learning curves but overall went very smoothly.
      </p><br/> 
  
      <p>I had fun with this project. It gave me a chance to put what we had been learning into practice and really reinforce my understanding of Mongoose, Express, and EJS.
